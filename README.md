Zkjs is a opensource project that contains serveral Javascript components:

Dropdownlist(or say select, or say combobox), with the feature of searchable, editable, it is powerful. Calendar also use the dropdownlist to select its year and month,it can choose hour and time if you set the datepatther with hours and minutes. Infinite series popupmenu. Powerful and easy-use tree, support radio node and checkbox node. you can extend them also. it has a better performance than most of the other opensource tree.
These components is for the good of ajax, they are event-driven, all this work fine in firefox,chrome,safari and IE.

==============================================

This is an old project developed before the first release of jQuery. Now I think the only useful component is the tree, so I clean it up and create a new project for the tree only https://imhazige.github.io/kee-tree/
